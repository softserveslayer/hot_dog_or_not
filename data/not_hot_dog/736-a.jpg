Have a look at a short review about this juicer to get more information about it.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;" align="JUSTIFY"><b>The design of Omega J8006</b></h2>
<figure id="attachment_31" style="width: 300px;" class="wp-caption alignright"><a href="http://www.eatanddrinkaustin.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/omega-j8006-juicer-1-1024x901.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-31" src="http://www.eatanddrinkaustin.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/omega-j8006-juicer-1-1024x901-300x264.jpg" alt="Omega J8006" width="300" height="264" /></a><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Omega J8006</figcaption></figure>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="JUSTIFY">The design of Omega J8006 is unique and amazing. The juice that is extracted by this juicer will help you in even eating the fiber of the veggies and fruits because it is going to extract the maximum minerals, enzymes and vitamins possible and makes the juice really healthy and tasty as well. The extraction power of this juicer is just amazing and the efficiency is also superb and that is because of the dual stage juicing facility provided in it. The base of the juicer is wide and it is very easy for you to balance it.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;" align="JUSTIFY"><b>Have a look at its key features</b></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="JUSTIFY">You can extract the juices of fruits and also vegetables. The pulp after extraction is going to be extremely dry because the complete juice is extracted from it. The cleaning process of this juicer is pretty simple and easy. You get this Omega J8006 slow juicer with 15 years of warranty and this is said to be the best part of buying the juicer. But there is another very interesting feature about this juicer and that is you can use this juicer in two ways. You can use it as a juicer and also as a grinder. Yes, you read it right, you can use it as a grinder as well. You can make nut butter with the help of this juicer and you can even make things like nut milk.

<h2 style="text-align: justify;" align="JUSTIFY"><b>Pros about Omega J8006 slow juicer</b></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="JUSTIFY">The juicer works really well and the extraction power is just superb. The operation of the juicer is silent and this is not present in most of the juicers. The pulp after extraction comes out automatically and hence you can keep blending the juice for a long time if you want to. The cleaning process of this juicer is very simple as there are no too many curves. You will not find too much foam in the juice even after blending for a long time, which is seen in many juicers. Juice does not get hot when you are blending for a long time and saves the freshness of the juice.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: justify;" align="JUSTIFY"><b>Cons about Omega J8006 slow juicer</b></h2>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="JUSTIFY">You cannot place the fruits or veggies directly into the blender, you will have to chop them into very small pieces. If you cannot cut them, then you should forget about it.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;" align="JUSTIFY">Compared to the cons, the number of pros you can see in this juicer are high and you should definitely try it.</p>
